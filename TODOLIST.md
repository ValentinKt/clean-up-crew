- [x] Fix TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'title')
- [x] Fix OpenStreetMap tile loading error (ERR_ABORTED) - investigate CORS or network issues
- [x] Test the application thoroughly to ensure all fixes work correctly
- [x] Clean up console logs - Remove excessive console.log and console.warn statements

## Current Task: Add 5 New Users and 5 New Events

### Pending Tasks - REQUIRES MANUAL ACTION FIRST
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Deploy database schema to Supabase (REQUIRED BEFORE ADDING DATA)
- [ ] Create 5 new users with realistic data (script ready: `scripts/test-connection.js`)
- [ ] Create 5 new events with realistic data (scripts ready: `scripts/test-connection.js` + `scripts/add-more-events.js`)
- [ ] Test the application with new users and events
- [ ] Fix any issues that arise during testing

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Database Schema Must Be Deployed First

**Current Status**: Cannot add users/events because database schema is not deployed.

### Steps to Deploy Database Schema:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects
2. **Select your project**: bshbpfgjgwqocczlzztb
3. **Navigate to SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. **Copy the entire content** from `database.sql`
5. **Paste and execute** the SQL in the editor
6. **Verify deployment** by checking if tables and functions are created

### What the deployment will create:
- Tables: `users`, `events`, `event_participants`, `event_equipment`, `event_chat`, `event_photos`
- RLS policies for data security
- RPC functions: `create_new_event`, `get_event_by_id`, `join_event`, `leave_event`, etc.

## Scripts Ready for Data Insertion

Once database is deployed, run these scripts:

1. **Add 5 users + 2 events**: `node scripts/test-connection.js`
2. **Add 3 more events**: `node scripts/add-more-events.js`

## Status Summary
✅ All code fixes completed successfully
✅ Tests passing (8/8)
✅ Build successful
✅ Preview server running without errors
✅ Console logs cleaned up
✅ Data insertion scripts prepared
❌ Database schema not deployed (manual action required)

**Next Step**: Deploy database schema, then run the prepared scripts to add users and events!
