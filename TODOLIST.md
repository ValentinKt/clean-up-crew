# Todo List - Eco Cleanup Crew

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Fix RPC function error - `create_new_event` function not found
- [x] Fix TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'title')
- [x] Fix OpenStreetMap tile loading error (ERR_ABORTED) - investigate CORS or network issues
- [x] Test the application thoroughly to ensure all fixes work correctly

## Pending Tasks - REQUIRES MANUAL ACTION
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Deploy database schema to Supabase - RPC functions still not found in schema cache
- [ ] **ACTION REQUIRED**: User needs to manually deploy database.sql to Supabase via SQL Editor

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

The application code has been fixed, but the database schema needs to be deployed manually:

### Steps to Deploy Database Schema:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects
2. **Select your project**: bshbpfgjgwqocczlzztb
3. **Navigate to SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. **Copy the entire content** from `services/database.sql`
5. **Paste and execute** the SQL in the editor
6. **Verify deployment** by checking if tables and functions are created

### What the deployment will create:
- Tables: `users`, `events`, `event_participants`, `event_equipment`, `event_chat`, `event_photos`
- RLS policies for data security
- RPC functions: `create_new_event`, `get_event_by_id`, `join_event`, `leave_event`, etc.

## Status Summary
✅ All code fixes completed successfully
✅ Tests passing (8/8)
✅ Build successful
✅ Preview server running without errors
❌ Database schema not deployed (manual action required)

The application is ready to use once the database schema is deployed!
