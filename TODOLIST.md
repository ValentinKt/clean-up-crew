# Todo List - Eco Cleanup Crew

## MapPicker Enhancement Tasks

[x] Examine current MapPicker component structure and dependencies
[x] Implement click event handling on map surface to capture coordinates
[x] Add visual marker/pin for selected location on map
[x] Update location input field to be disabled and auto-populate from map selection
[x] Ensure two-way binding and proper event emission for location changes
[x] Add mobile/touch device compatibility
[x] Handle edge cases and accessibility standards
[x] Test enhanced MapPicker functionality and commit changes
[x] Create unit tests for interactive map features

## Test Suite Development Tasks

[x] Create unit tests for CreateEventForm component
[x] Create unit tests for eventService functions
[x] Run complete test suite and verify all tests pass
[x] Commit comprehensive test suite to version control

## Completed Features

✅ **Interactive Map Selection**: Users can now click anywhere on the map to set the event location
✅ **Visual Feedback**: Circle style changes temporarily when a location is selected
✅ **Coordinate Display**: Disabled input field shows user-friendly coordinates (latitude, longitude)
✅ **Mobile Compatibility**: Enhanced touch handling and responsive design
✅ **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
✅ **Error Handling**: Robust handling of invalid coordinates and network errors
✅ **Two-way Binding**: Proper state management and event emission
✅ **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 32 tests covering components and services with full mocking

## Next Steps

[ ] Deploy database schema to Supabase (create_new_event function missing)
[ ] Create integration tests for complete event creation workflow
[ ] Create validation tests for required fields and input formats
[ ] Create error handling tests for invalid/missing data
[ ] Create edge case tests for event creation
[ ] Consider adding location history/favorites functionality
[ ] Implement location validation against cleanup event requirements
