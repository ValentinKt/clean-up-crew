1. Commit changes regularly to the repository.
2. Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage your code.
3. Continue your todolist task until it is totally completed. Use the `TODOLIST.md` file to read, write, and manipulate tasks in order to follow your the advancement for the current project. Add new task systemically the file `TODOLIST.md` in order to manage all your todolist's tasks. Follow this format for each task : `[ ] [task description]` when the task is not completed, and `[x] [task description]` when the task is completed. Next, commit the changes to the repository.
4. /!\ Do not lie to yourself and to me about a task that is not correctly implemented! /!\ 
5. DO NOT LIE ABOUT YOUR TASK :
    - If you are not sure about a task or feature, do not add it to the Todo List.
    - If you are sure about a task or feature, add it to the Todo List.
    - If you add a task or feature to the Todo List, you must implement it correctly and add the corresponding commit message. 
    - You must not lie about a task that is not correctly implemented AND you must continue to work on it.
    - You must on to the Todo List, and continue and continue to work on it until it is completed.
6. Use a Modern, User-Friendly, Environmental (teal/green color) based for UI. The UX should be intuitive, easy to use and "juicy".
