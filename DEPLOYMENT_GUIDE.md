# ðŸš€ Database Schema Deployment Guide

## Current Issue
Your event creation is failing because the database schema hasn't been deployed to Supabase yet. The error `"Could not find the function api.create_new_event"` indicates that the RPC functions are missing from your Supabase database.

## Quick Fix - Manual Deployment (Recommended)

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project: **bshbpfgjgwqocczlzztb**

### Step 2: Open SQL Editor
1. Click on **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"New query"** to create a new SQL query

### Step 3: Deploy Schema
1. Open the file `services/database.sql` in your code editor
2. **Copy the entire content** (all 453 lines)
3. **Paste it into the SQL Editor** in Supabase
4. Click **"Run"** to execute the SQL

### Step 4: Verify Deployment
After successful execution, run this command to verify:
```bash
node scripts/test-connection.js
```

You should see: âœ… **"Database connection successful!"**

## Alternative Method - Supabase CLI

If you prefer using the CLI and have Docker running:

```bash
# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Link your project
supabase link --project-ref bshbpfgjgwqocczlzztb

# Deploy schema
supabase db push
```

## What Gets Deployed

The schema includes:

### ðŸ“Š Tables
- `users` - User profiles and authentication
- `events` - Cleanup events
- `event_participants` - Event participation tracking
- `event_equipment` - Equipment lists for events
- `event_chat` - Event chat messages
- `event_photos` - Event photo uploads

### ðŸ”§ RPC Functions
- `create_new_event` - Creates new cleanup events (this fixes your error!)
- `get_event_by_id` - Retrieves event details
- `get_all_events` - Lists all events
- `join_event` / `leave_event` - Event participation
- `add_equipment_item` / `toggle_equipment_item` - Equipment management
- `send_chat_message` - Chat functionality
- `update_event_status` - Event status updates

### ðŸ”’ Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Proper authentication checks
- Secure function definitions

## After Deployment

Once deployed successfully:

1. âœ… Event creation will work
2. âœ… All RPC functions will be available
3. âœ… The "null is not an object" error will disappear
4. âœ… Your application will be fully functional

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
- Check that you have admin permissions on the Supabase project
- Ensure you copied the entire schema content
- Look for any error messages in the SQL Editor

### If the test still fails:
- Wait a few seconds for the schema to propagate
- Refresh your browser and try again
- Check the Supabase project logs

## Need Help?

Run the deployment helper script for detailed instructions:
```bash
node scripts/deploy-schema.js
```
